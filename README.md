3.DigEdit 
          As detailed by several sources, visually representing graph data greatly aids computer users when navigating complex relational datasets.  Using the discussion graph engine and content file format described by Jones and Seroka in A PHP-Based Discussion Graph Engine, this paper presents a visualization application called DigEdit for editing and viewing discussion graphs.  This paper also discusses the design paradigms involved in the development of the DigEdit application, from object-oriented programming to HCI (human computer interaction).
